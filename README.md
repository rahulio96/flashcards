## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Unfortunately, I had a busy week and was not able to implement a lot of stuff I planned on including, such as a theme, the ability to reshuffle the flashcards, to get to the end of the deck and restart, the previous button actually working, and some other smaller features...
- Big challenge I ran into was with the next button and being able to go to the next flashcard. I had the buttons in the home component and finally ended up moving them to the flashcard component so it would work properly.
